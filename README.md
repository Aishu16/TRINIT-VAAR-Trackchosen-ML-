# TRINIT-VAAR-Trackchosen-ML-
In this image caption generating for remote sensor images.
First we have converted the byte array stream of images to byte array object of images.
Then we tokenized the captions and created a vocabulary from it for our ml model.
Next we tried to build the model which is a combination of cnn(for feature extraction) and rnn(for caption generation).
